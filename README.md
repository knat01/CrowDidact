### CrowDidact is a crowd-sourced & automated learning platform.

CrowDidact allows users to create courses that are auto-populated with content simply by entering the name of the subject.
Users can then collaborate & learn on this generated page by uploading their own content.

The demo video on Devpost shows a user creating a course by entering the phrase "Java Programming".
The material in the screenshots below was collected from the internet by the website.
